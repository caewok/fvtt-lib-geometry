 * does the Wall class.
 *
 * Note that changing A or B after construction may result in incorrect _nw and _se values.
 * To avoid this, one would have to either:
 * a. Track any changes to the underlying A and B vertices, even if implicitly done by
 *    getting the vertex and then changing the referenced coordinates; or
 * b. Forcing _nw and _se to be calculated every time, not cached.
 *
 * See https://jsbench.me/5ml157u7e8/2 for performance tradeoffs and Wall.js for details.
